Biological Description                   := The Drushocka evolved on a world very prone to intense lightning storms, probably resulting in their desire to control energy as best they can. Physically they rather resemble greenish moss-covered boulders. They move through the oscillation of these moss fibers along their bodies. Suffice to say, they move very slow. However, they make up for this in physical toughness.
Society Description                      := It is believed that the Drushocka follow a dictatorial feudal system, with each lesser 'caste' swearing alliegence to a lord above it, and those lords swearing alliegence to a ruler who is chosen by the former ruler before he dies. The Drushocka are best characterized as inflexible and straightfoward. They see a goal, they move towards it and they attain it.
General History Description              := Although the Drushocka are considered intellectually sluggish, their relatively peaceful society has steadily advanced developing unique organic technologies that have allowed them to enter space and explore the galaxy.
Personality Group                        := 3
